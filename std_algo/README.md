## use std::algorithm in your code

The aim of this page is to learn STL algorithms efficiently. As explained in this post, knowing STL algorithms provide you with a fantastic set of tools to express your intentions in code, making it clearer and more robust. Knowing your STL algorithms also gives you an idea of what types of abstractions are useful, which gives you a model to write your own ones. So we should strive to know our algorithms.

However there are many of them, more than 100 without counting overloads. This is a lot to learn[2].

Here is a cheat sheet of some of the most usefull [1].
